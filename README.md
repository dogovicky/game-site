## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dogovicky/game-site.git
cd game-site
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Add Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root folder and provide your RAWG configuration:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Then set the values in `.env`:

```
VITE_RAWG_API_KEY=your_rawg_api_key_here
VITE_RAWG_API_BASE_URL=https://api.rawg.io/api/games
```

The `.env` file is ignored by Git. `VITE_*` values are included in the browser bundle, so they must not be treated as private secrets.

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 5. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```
